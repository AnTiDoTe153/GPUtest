<h2>About</h2>

<p>  &emsp;&emsp; If you asked me for a hamburger, but it turns out I don't really exist. Where I was 
    originally standing, a picture of a hamburger rests on the ground. Why are we speaking German? A mime cries softly as he cradles a young cow.
    Your grandfather stares at you as the cow falls apart into patties.
    You look down only to see me with pickles for eyes, I am singing the song that gives birth to the universe.
